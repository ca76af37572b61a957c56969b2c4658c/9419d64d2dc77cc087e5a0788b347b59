1 st. task:
DNS key leak:

I have used the following commands on my DNS master:

    tsig-keygen transfer.key
    tsig-keygen nsupdate.key

Than with ansible vault I have encrypted the output keys.

Finally I have put no_log: true in ansible code where I use the keys.

Purged bind9, deleted all config files and run ansible


2 nd. task:
Change agama containers from 2 to 5 with loop, change agama_containers_per_vm at all.yaml to 5
It was stressful and difficult
